# Webpack 5 Boilerplate to start basic project using HTML, SCSS & JS

This template can be used to start off a project using HTML, SCSS and JS with
webpack 5. I've created this as a boilerplate for my projects. Feel free to use
it for your projects if you need it.

This template has the following

- Production config file
- Development config file
- Public folder for all assets
- Source folder for source code
- SCSS basic folder structure with reset applied
- package.json with '`npm run`' commands and '`devDependencies`'
- Basic gitignore file
